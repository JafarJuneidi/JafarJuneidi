## Naming

If you know anything about software, tech or coding, you might be asking youself:

> What's with the title? Error? Exe? do you know anything about tech?!

Well, exactly. I didn't know anything. Here's the story:

Context: I just graduated highschool, scoring 98.4% (pretty decent). And the extent of my knowledge of computers was probably the many games I've played up to that point, and the scam tutorials I followed to boost my ping by typing magic commands in the terminal... yeah 😅.
I was walking with my best friend who was a computer engineering freshmen at the time (we'll call him Mo).

Mo: coding is fun. Been working on this web project lately (bro was probably writing HTML 🙂), but I'm kinda stuck with an error.

Jafar: yeah? ErrorExe probably, wait... or is it Exe404?... 😐

Mo: you mean a 404Error? 😂

Jafar: yeah, that 😂

Mo: and you were considering to go study computer engineering?!

And here I am, a computer engineering gradute. We still laugh about it to this day.
I'd like to think that those conversation's with Mo - either directly or indirectly - were the reason I went ahead and majored in Tech.
And I'm very happy were I am. So I found it appropriate to name my first blog with something from that past.

"ErrorExe" will stick with me for as long as I code.

## Content

Nothing specific is yet in mind. Projects, solutions to annoying problems are the first things that came to me. But I might consider writing about myself outside of tech as well.

time will tell...

## Reasons for starting

The idea started with me wanted to document my journey as a developer. And for the blog to be kind of like a big "about me" page, to increase my chances of landing a good job.

But outside of that, I wanted to write. I believe writing will teach me a lot and help improve the way I articulate my thoughts. And hopefully I'll aslo be able to teach someone something as well and make some friends, that'd be nice.
